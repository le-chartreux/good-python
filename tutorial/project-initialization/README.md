# Project Initialization

In this pivotal chapter, we will lay the foundation for our project by achieving two essential steps: establishing the project's [file architecture](file-architecture.md), [configuring](configuration.md) it then [installing](installation.md) it.

By the conclusion of this chapter, you will have a fully prepared project environment, poised for the coding journey ahead.
