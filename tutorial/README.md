# Modern Python Tutorial

Welcome to the Modern Python Tutorial, designed to empower hands-on learners with a comprehensive journey through the entire process of Python project development â€“ from the initial concept to successful deployment.

In this tutorial, you will embark on a step-by-step journey to create a tiny software application called *cleather*: a mix of [*CLI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), *clean project* and *weather*.
The goal of *cleather* is to provide a terminal application for retrieving weather information for any location using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
Despite its simplicity, the development of *cleather* encompasses a broad range of essential aspects of modern Python development, including project management (from configuration to deployment on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)), ensuring code quality (including testing, documentation, linting, formatting, and type checking), and automating actions (both locally and in CI/CD).

To get started, head over to [Chapter 1 - Project Initialization](project-initialization/README.md).
