## Language Agnostic

This part highlight setup that you will do on any project with any language.

First of all, create the directory for your project - our will be `sters`.

```sh
mkdir sters
cd sters
```

Then initialize [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to get some version control.
This is not required, but I strongly recommand to use a version control system.

```sh
git init
```

Then you will need to create three files:

- `README.md`, a description of your project and the ways to install it to your users. For now, leave it blank.
- `.gitignore`, the list of filesystem elements that Git will ignore. You can use [this one](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore).
- `LICENSE`, to protect your work. Refer to [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/) to find the one that suits you. I will go for the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/).

Now your file structure should be the following:

```tree
sters
├── .git
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

## Language Specific

Now, let's dig onto the Python-specific configuration.
