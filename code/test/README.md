# Tests

Testing is crucial to ensure that your code works as intended: you can't assume a code works without testing it. A good test should be both [atomic](atomic.md) and [well-documented](documentation.md). You can use the [recommanded tools](tools.md) to test your code, and refer to the [example](example-of-unit-test.md) of a unit test for a practical demonstration.
