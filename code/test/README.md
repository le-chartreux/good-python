# Tests

Testing is necessary: you can't assume a code works without testing it. A good Python test should be [atomic](atomic.md) and [documented](documentation.md). You can use the [recommanded tools](tools.md) to test your code. See [the example](example-of-unit-test.md) to get a practical view.
