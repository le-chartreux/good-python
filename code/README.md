# Good Python code

To write good Python code, it's important to focus on several key aspects. These include [documentation](documentation/README.md), [formatting](format.md), [adherence to PEP 8 guidelines](pep-8-compliance.md), [testing](test/README.md), and [type-checking](type-check.md). By prioritizing these aspects of Python coding, you can create code that is not only functional but also maintainable and easy to understand.
