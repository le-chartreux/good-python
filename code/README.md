# Good Python code

To write good Python code, it is important to focus on several key aspects. These include [documentation](documentation/README.md), [formatting](format.md), [adherence to PEP-8 guidelines](pep-8-compilance.md), [testing](test.md) and [type-checking](type-check.md). 

[Documentation](documentation/README.md) is essential for ensuring that others can understand and use your code effectively. [Proper formatting](format.md) makes your code more readable and easier to maintain. [Adhering to PEP-8 guidelines](pep-8-compilance.md) ensures consistency and readability across your codebase. [Testing](test.md) and [type-checking](type-check.md) help catch errors and ensure that your code works as expected.

By prioritizing these aspects of Python coding, you can create code that is not only functional but also maintainable and easy to understand.
