# Host

Once you have [generated](generate.md) your documentation using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), you can host it using a platform like [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) to make it easily accessible to others.

[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is a popular free hosting platform for documentation that allows you to easily publish and manage your documentation. It supports a variety of documentation formats, including Sphinx, and provides features such as versioning, search functionality, and analytics.

To host your [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), follow the [Read the Docs tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html). This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating an account, connecting your code repository, configuring your documentation, and publishing it on Read the Docs.
