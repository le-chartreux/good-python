# Host

Once you have [generated](generate.md) your documentation using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), you can host it using a platform like [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/). By hosting your documentation on a platform like [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), you can make it easily accessible to others, ensuring that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.

[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is a popular free hosting platform for documentation that allows you to easily publish and manage your documentation. It supports a variety of documentation formats, including Sphinx, and provides features such as versioning, search functionality, and analytics.

To host your Sphinx documentation on Read the Docs, follow the [platform's instructions](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html).
