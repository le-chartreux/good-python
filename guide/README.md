# Modern Python Guide

Creating a good Python program requires attention to both the [quality of the code](code/README.md) and the [overall project](project/README.md).
I recommand starting with the [project](project/README.md) section, as it introduces some concepts used in the [code](code/README.md) section, and ending with the [automation](automation/README.md) section.
By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Python programs are not only functional but also maintainable and easy to understand.
