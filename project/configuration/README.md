# Configuration

The configuration of a Python project is crucial for ensuring that installation, development, and deployment are simple for contributors.
In 2016, [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) was introduced, which specified that the configuration of Python projects should be contained in a unified file named `pyproject.toml`.
This chapter will explain how to [set up](set-up.md) and [use](usage.md) a project with a `pyproject.toml` file.
