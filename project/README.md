# Good Python Project

A good Python project should have a well-organized [file architecture](file-architecture.md) and a [configuration](configuration.md) that enables easy [installation](installation.md) and [automation](automation.md).
By having these two essential qualities, a Python project can attract more contributors and make it easier for them to contribute to the project.
