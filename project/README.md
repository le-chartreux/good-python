# Good Python Project

A well-designed Python project is essential for achieving success in software development.
To ensure that a Python project is efficient and effective, it should have a well-structured [file architecture](file-architecture.md) and a user-friendly [configuration](configuration.md) that simplifies [installation](installation.md) and [deployment](deployment.md).
These key elements not only attract more contributors, but also make it easier for them to contribute to the project.
In this chapter, we will explore the essential qualities of a good Python project and how they can facilitate the development process.
