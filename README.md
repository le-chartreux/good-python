# Good Python

Small tutorial about the key aspects of writing good Python programs and the tools available to ensure its quality. It does not treat the coding rules (like DRY) that apply to every modern language but focus on Python-specific rules.  

To create a good Python program, it is essential to focus on both the [quality of the code](code/README.md) and the [overall project structure](project/README.md).
