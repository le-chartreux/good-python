# Modern Python

[Modern Python](https://github.com/le-chartreux/modern-python/) is an educational resource that covers key aspects of writing high-quality modern Python programs and the tools available to ensure their quality.
While it does not delve into [programming principles that apply to every modern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles), it focuses on Python-specific rules.
By following this documentation, you can ensure that your Python programs are not only functional but also maintainable and easy to understand.

You can either follow the [tutorial](tutorial/README.md) to learn by doing, or the [guide](guide/README.md) to learn by theory.
Both approaches are complementary and can help you gain a deeper understanding of the subject.
