# Good Python

[Good Python](https://github.com/le-chartreux/good-python/) is a small tutorial that covers key aspects of writing high-quality Python programs and the tools available to ensure their quality.
While it does not delve into [programming principles that apply to every modern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles), it focuses on Python-specific rules.

Creating a good Python program requires attention to both the [quality of the code](code/README.md) and the [overall project](project/README.md).
The tutorial provides guidance on both of these aspects, with separate sections dedicated to code quality and project structure.
I recommand starting with the [project](project/README.md) section, as it introduces some concepts used in the [code](code/README.md) section.
By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Python programs are not only functional but also maintainable and easy to understand.
