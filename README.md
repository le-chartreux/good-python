# Good Python

Small tutorial about the key aspects of writing good Python programs and the tools available to ensure its quality. It does not treat the [programming principles that apply to every modern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles) but focus on Python-specific rules.  

To create a good Python program, it is essential to focus on both the [quality of the code](code/README.md) and the [overall project structure](project/README.md).
